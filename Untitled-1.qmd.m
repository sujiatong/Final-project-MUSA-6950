# Large Language Model (LLM) for Sentiment Analyzing and Image Reasoning

---
## What is LLMs?

Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced artificial intelligence systems designed to understand, generate, and manipulate human language on a large scale.

## Project summary
- Build a lightweight system using an LLM (ChatGPT)
- Implement two key functionalities:
  - Sentiment analysis of text inputs
  - Image-based reasoning through textual description
  
---

**To obtain the API key, navigate to https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys.**
- free usage limit of the OpenAI API was not sufficient for this project, so I spent around $20 to access additional API credits and complete the assignment.
- Access to the OpenAI API may be blocked on certain restricted networks (e.g., school Wi-Fi), requiring workarounds like VPNs or mobile hotspots.

# Task 1: Sentiment Analysis

- The system takes a text input from the user.
- The text is sent to the LLM with a carefully designed prompt asking the model to analyze its sentiment.
- The model returns a result classifying the input as positive, negative, or neutral, along with a brief summary.


---
```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hi"}
    ]
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)

```

`
Hello! How can I assist you today?
`

---

```Python

text = "Happy Graduate"

sentiment = response.choices[0].message.content
print(sentiment)
if sentiment == "Positive":
    print("üòä")
elif sentiment == "Negative":
    print("üòî")
else:
    print("üòê")

```
`Positive
üòä`

# Task 2: Image-Related Reasoning

- Instead of processing raw image data directly, publicly available image URLs are used.
- Text prompts describing the image URLs are fed into the LLM.
- The model generates descriptive text based on the imagined content of the images, simulating a simple form of visual reasoning.

# Ask the model to describe what it sees

```Python
async_resp = await openai_llm.astream_chat(messages=[msg])
async for delta in async_resp:
    print(delta.delta, end="")
```

`1. A close-up of an orange tabby cat with striking amber eyes, looking directly at the camera. The background is blurred, highlighting the cat's face and whiskers.`

`2. A white cat with heterochromia, featuring one yellow eye and one blue eye. The cat is lying on a soft, multicolored blanket, with a focused and curious expression.`
